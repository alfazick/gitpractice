## 1) Tracking of changes ##
For each commit, Git generates a SHA-1 hash as the commit identifier. 

The hash is based on the current time, the author, the parent commit ID, and some other information.

The commit hash is generated by Git automatically. We get a new hash each time.


a) git status keeps track of (untracked, tracked, staged) 

b) git log  commited

Git don't keep track of folders, to start to keep empty folders
you can create empty .gitkeep file

## 2) Branches

a) Create a Branch

```
$ git switch -c new_feature
```

git switches to a new branch

# Exercise

a) Run the following commands in the terminal:

```
$ git switch -c new_feature
```

b) Create some files.
```
$ touch new_feature_branch.py
```

c) Run the git add . command.
```
$ git add new_feature_branch.py
```

d) Run the following git commit command:
```
$ git commit -m "First commit in new_feature branch."
```

e) Run the git log command.
```
$ git log
```

f) Go back to the master branch.
```
$ git switch master
```

g) Make changes in master.
```
$ touch new_feature_main.py
$ git add new_feature_main.py
$ git commit -m "Make changes in master."
```

h) Run the git log command again.
```
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

Note:
For older version of git

We can use git checkout branch_name to switch between branches and 
git checkout -b new_branch_name to create a new branch
