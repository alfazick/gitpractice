Walk through an example of developing a new feature called "Button" in a structured Git workflow, step by step.


Step 1: Create the Feature Branch
First, you'll create a new feature branch from the development branch. 
This isolates your new feature work from other ongoing developments.

```
git checkout development  # Make sure you're on the development branch
git pull origin development  # Update local development branch
git checkout -b feature_button  # Create and switch to the new feature branch
```

Step 2: Develop the Feature
Now, you'll work on the feature in the feature_button branch. This involves writing code, testing, and possibly iterating based on feedback or additional requirements. You commit your changes regularly to this branch.
```
# Work on the feature, then add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial Button functionality"

```

Step 3: Update the Feature Branch
It's good practice to regularly update your feature branch with any changes that have been made in the development branch. This reduces potential conflicts when you're ready to merge.

```
git checkout development
git pull origin development  # Get the latest updates from the development branch
git checkout feature_button
git merge development  # Merge updates into your feature branch
```

Step 4: Code Review and Testing

Once your feature is ready, you'll push the branch to the remote repository and open a pull request (PR) against the development branch. Your team will review the code, and you might need to make some changes based on their feedback.

```
git push origin feature_button  # Push the feature branch to the remote
```


Then go to your Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and open a pull request


Step 5: Merge the Feature Branch
After the feature passes the code review and any additional tests, it's merged into the development branch. This makes the feature part of the broader development efforts.

```
# Merge the feature branch into development (usually done via the Git hosting service)
git checkout development
git merge feature_button
git push origin development
```


Step 6: Staging for Further Testing

Once your development branch has accumulated enough features for a release, or periodically, you may push it to a staging branch where the code can be tested in an environment that mimics production.

```
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
git merge development  # Merge the latest development branch into staging
git push origin staging
```

Step 7: Deployment to Production
After thorough testing and client approval in the staging environment, the code is merged from the staging branch into the master/main branch, which is then deployed to production.

```git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge staging  # Merge staging into master, which is ready for production
git push origin master
```

Step 8: Hotfixes If Needed
If any critical bugs are found in production, you would create a hotfix branch from master, fix the bug, and then follow a similar process to merge the hotfix back into both master and development branches.

This example covers the lifecycle of a feature from development to deployment in a structured Git workflow, ensuring stability and thorough testing at each stage of the process.
