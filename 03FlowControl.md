# Flow Control #

Flow of branches in a structured Git workflow, where each branch serves a specific purpose in the development lifecycle. Here's a breakdown of each type of branch you mentioned and how they typically interact:

1) Master (or Main) Branch:

Purpose: This branch holds the code that is currently running in production. It should be the most stable version of your project.
Common Practices: Only fully tested, approved, and stable code is merged into this branch. Releases are typically tagged in this branch.


2) Development Branch:

Purpose: Acts as the primary branch for developers to commit their ongoing work, knowing that it might not always be stable.
Common Practices: All the feature branches are merged back into the development branch once they reach a certain level of maturity. This is where most of the integration happens before the code is moved to more stable branches.

3) Feature Branches:

Purpose: Each new feature or significant update is developed in its own branch, which is created from the development branch.
Common Practices: These branches are named after the feature or the developer's task (e.g., feature_login, dev_auth). Once the feature is complete and tested, it's merged back into the development branch.

4) Staging Branch:

Purpose: Used for final testing and quality assurance before the code is moved to production.
Common Practices: Code in the staging branch represents what will be in the next release. It's a mirror of what will become production but is used as a final testing and client approval stage.

5) Deployment Branch:

Purpose: Some workflows include a deployment branch, which might hold code that's configured specifically for production but needs to be kept separate until deployment.
Common Practices: This branch might have production-specific configurations that are not in the main/master branch. It is used to actually deploy software into the production environment.

6) Hotfix Branches:

Purpose: These are emergency branches created from the master/main branch to quickly address and fix critical bugs found in production.
Common Practices: After a hotfix is completed, it is merged back into both the master and development branches to ensure that the fix is integrated into the future releases as well.


The flow between these branches ensures that the codebase goes through various stages of stability and testing. From individual features being developed in isolation to integration and testing in a collective environment, and finally being stable enough for production. This structured branching strategy helps manage development in a scalable, organized way, minimizing disruptions in the main production environment and improving the overall quality of the software.
